# APIVersioningPoc

**Intent** :- Moreover, requirements change over time — thus, our API has to change as well.

When we implement some breaking changes, we want to ensure that we don’t do anything that will cause our API consumers to change their code. Those breaking changes could be:
• Renaming fields, properties, or resource URIs.
• Changes in the payload structure.
• Modifying response codes or HTTP Verbs.
• Redesigning our API endpoints.
